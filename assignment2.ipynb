It is easy to understand and support non English speaker to fill it out by offering it in other languages. The unanimous also helps to get people to fill it out. As well as providing an online version to fill out. One thing they might miss is gathering more data frequently as it can be outdated (like a financial crisis that causes people to move). Large scale survey would be good if they can have like a certain day(s) where people go to a location to fill out the form if they want and this also brings more public awareness. They could add more races or even a blank box if it is too many options. They could get a more accurate data with this Information."

Issues with missing values add challenges as they cannot assume certain parts like gender. Some good practice in cleaning data is being really safe and generlize certain things like gender missing data and put them as nan. However a malicious data cleaner could manipulate the data and put it where it benefits certain groups or attack a group of people."
